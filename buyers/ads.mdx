## 1. Access the Ads Page

To begin integrating ads into your Buyer App, navigate to the Ads page in your AdNet dashboard.

## 2. Ad Creation

When creating an ad, you'll need to provide several details as shown in the image below:

These details are crucial for our ad auction system. Behind the scenes, we use this information to determine which ads should be displayed to users based on relevance and bidding. The auction process ensures that the most appropriate and highest-bidding ads are shown to users, maximizing value for both advertisers and your app users.

## 3. Integration Steps

Once you've set up your ad campaigns, follow these steps to integrate ads into your Buyer App:

### Step 1: Attach Script

Add the following script to the end of the `<body>` tag in your main `index.html` file. This script initializes the ad client on your page.

<CodeGroup>

```html index.html
<script src="http://localhost:8080/ad.js?bap_id=6e0908hxu48y8m"></script>
```


</CodeGroup>



### Step 2: Fetch Ads

Call the `ad.fetch()` method to retrieve ads based on the specified parameters:

<CodeGroup>



``` javascript 
ad.fetch({
    unit: string,
    type: string,
    city: string,
    state: string,
    keywords: string,
    floorBid: number,
    slots: number
});
```


</CodeGroup>

### Step 3: Handle Ad Clicks

Implement a click handler for ads within your Buyer App:

<CodeGroup>


``` javascript 
    ad.select({
    bpp: string,
    provider: string,
    item: string,
    quantity: number,
    location: gps
});
```
