# Types of Ads

Our platform offers three main types of ads, each designed to reach users in different contexts and maximize engagement. Let's explore each type:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Menu Ads">
    Menu Ads are locality-based advertisements specifically designed for restaurants. When a user searches for dining options in a particular area, these ads showcase the entire menu of a restaurant.

    - **Key Feature**: Displays the full menu of a restaurant
    - **Targeting**: Based on user's location
    - **Best For**: Local restaurants looking to attract nearby customers
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Search Ads">
    Search Ads are keyword-based advertisements that match the user's intent. These ads appear when users search for specific products or services.

    - **Key Feature**: Matches user's search keywords
    - **Targeting**: Based on user's search query
    - **Best For**: Businesses wanting to reach users actively looking for their products or services
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Display Ads">
    Display Ads are based on user traffic and general category preferences. These ads appear on various pages across the platform, not necessarily tied to a specific search.

    - **Key Feature**: Visual ads showcasing products or services
    - **Targeting**: Based on user behavior and interests
    - **Best For**: Businesses looking to increase brand awareness and reach a broader audience

<Note>
  The placement of ads significantly impacts their effectiveness. Ads placed at the top of a page generally perform better than those in the middle or at the bottom.

All of these ad types use Cost Per Click (CPC) as the primary metric for revenue. This means advertisers only pay when a user actually clicks on their ad.
