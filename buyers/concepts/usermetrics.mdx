description: Understanding how we collect and use user data for better ad targeting

To provide the most relevant ads and valuable insights, we use a Client side SDK that helps us understand how users interact with your site. <br/>
This process is designed to be unobtrusive while gathering important data that benefits both advertisers and users.

## How It Works

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="SDK Integration" icon="puzzle-piece">
    When you integrate our ads into your site, you'll also include our lightweight JavaScript SDK. This SDK runs in the background and doesn't affect your site's performance.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="User Entry" icon="door-open">
    As soon as a user enters your site, the SDK begins its work. It starts collecting anonymous data about the user's journey through your site.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Traffic Aggregation" icon="users">
    The SDK aggregates traffic data from all users, giving us a comprehensive view of how people are interacting with your site as a whole.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="User Journey Mapping" icon="map">
    We analyze the paths users take through your site, including which pages they visit, how long they stay, and what actions they take.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Insights Generation" icon="lightbulb">
    Using this data, we generate insights about user behavior, preferences, and patterns. This helps us understand what kind of content and products your users are most interested in.

  <Accordion title="Ad Targeting" icon="bullseye-arrow">
    These insights allow us to serve more relevant ads to your users, increasing the likelihood of engagement and conversions.

## Benefits of User Metrics

Understanding user metrics and traffic flow provides several benefits:

1. **Better Ad Relevance**: By understanding user interests and behavior, we can display ads that are more likely to be relevant and interesting to each user.

2. **Improved User Experience**: More relevant ads mean a better experience for your users, as they're more likely to see ads for products or services they're actually interested in.

3. **Higher Conversion Rates**: When ads are more relevant, users are more likely to click on them and make purchases, leading to higher conversion rates for advertisers.

4. **Valuable Insights for You**: The data we collect can provide you with valuable insights about your users, helping you improve your own site and offerings.

5. **Better ROI for Advertisers**: With more targeted ad placements, advertisers get a better return on their investment, encouraging them to continue advertising on your platform.

## Privacy and Data Protection

We take user privacy very seriously. All data collected by our SDK is:

- Anonymized to protect individual user identities
- Used only for the purposes of ad targeting and site optimization
- Handled in compliance with all relevant data protection regulations

Users can opt out of data collection at any time, and we provide clear information about our data practices to ensure transparency.

#### By leveraging these user metrics, we create a win-win situation: 
- Users see more relevant ads, advertisers get better results
- And you benefit from improved ad performance on your site.
