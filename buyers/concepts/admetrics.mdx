Ad metrics are essential for understanding how well your ads are performing and how they contribute to your business goals. Let's break down some key metrics and how we use them in our ad auctions.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Impressions" icon="eye">
    Impressions are the number of times your ad is shown to users. Think of it as how many eyeballs potentially saw your ad. While it doesn't guarantee interaction, it's a good measure of your ad's reach.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Clicks" icon="hand-pointer">
    Clicks represent how many times users actually clicked on your ad. This is a more active engagement than impressions and shows genuine interest in your offering.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Orders" icon="shopping-cart">
    Orders are the ultimate goal - they represent how many purchases were made as a result of your ad. This directly ties your ad performance to actual sales.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Click-Through Rate (CTR)" icon="percentage">
    CTR is the percentage of people who clicked on your ad after seeing it. It's calculated by dividing clicks by impressions. A higher CTR generally indicates that your ad is relevant and appealing to users.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Conversion Rate (CR)" icon="chart-line">
    CR shows the percentage of users who made a purchase after clicking on your ad. It's calculated by dividing orders by clicks. A high CR means your ad is not only attracting clicks but also leading to sales.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Cost Per Click (CPC)" icon="coins">
    CPC is how much you pay each time someone clicks on your ad. In our auction system, you set a maximum CPC you're willing to pay, but you might end up paying less depending on the competition.

## How We Use These Metrics in Ad Auctions


Our ad auction system uses these metrics to ensure that we're showing the most relevant ads to users while also providing value to advertisers. Here's a simplified explanation of how it works:

1. **Relevance**: We use metrics like CTR and CR to gauge how relevant and effective an ad is. Ads with higher engagement rates are more likely to be shown.

2. **Value**: The CPC you're willing to pay is balanced against the ad's performance metrics. An ad with a lower CPC but higher CTR might win over an ad with a higher CPC but lower CTR.

3. **User Experience**: We aim to show ads that users find useful and engaging, which is reflected in higher CTR and CR rates.

4. **Advertiser ROI**: By considering metrics like CR and Orders, we help ensure that advertisers are getting a good return on their investment.

5. **Fair Competition**: Our auction system allows businesses of all sizes to compete fairly. It's not just about who can pay the most, but who can create the most engaging and relevant ads.

By understanding these metrics and how they play into our ad auction system, you can create more effective ad campaigns and get better results from your advertising efforts on our platform.
